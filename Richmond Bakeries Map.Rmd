### Map

```{r map}

# Design custom popup

popInfoCircles <- paste(
  "<h2 style='font-family: Karla, sans-serif; font-size: 1.6em; color:#43464C;'>",bakery_table$`Bakery Name`, "</h2>",
  "<p style='font-family: Karla, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.5em; color:#9197A6;'>",     
  bakery_table$Description, "</p>",
  "<p style='font-family: Karla, sans-serif; font-weight: normal; text-align: center; font-size: 1em; 
  color:#9197A6;'>", bakery_table$Address, "</p>"
)

## to include a hyperlink to each bakery's website, use "<h2 style='font-family: Karla, sans-serif; font-size: 1.6em; color:#43464C;'>", "<a href=", bakery_table$Hyperlink, ">", bakery_table$`Bakery Name`, "</a></h2>"


# Make leaflet map

leaflet( data = shared, options = tileOptions(minZoom = 9, maxZoom = 19) ) %>%
  addCircles( lat = ~Latitude,          # add marker
              lng = ~Longitude,
              fillColor = "#009E91",    # customize marker
              popup = popInfoCircles,   # customize popup
              label = ~`Bakery Name`,
              labelOptions = labelOptions( style = list("font-family" = "Karla, sans-serif","font-size" = "1.2em") )
            ) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%    # add background map
  setView(mean(bakery_table$Longitude), 
          mean(bakery_table$Latitude), 
          zoom = 9) %>%
  leaflet.extras::addFullscreenControl()

```

### Reactable

```{r searchable-reactable}

reactable(data = shared, searchable = TRUE, resizable = TRUE, wrap = TRUE )

```


**Info**
===================================== 

### Overview

- This flexdashboard, was designed to practice web scraping, geocoding, and interactive mapping. It was developed by Toyin L. Ola.

- The data were scraped from a March 28, 2022 *Richmond Magazine* [article](https://richmondmagazine.com/restaurants-in-richmond/richmond-area-bakeries/) written by Eileen Mellon.

### Navigation Tips

- Hover over a map marker to see the name of the bakery. 

- Click on a map marker to open a popup displaying the bakery name, description, and address. 

- The reactable is searchable, and the columns can be resized.

- Use the filters in the left-hand sidebar to filter the map and table. 

- There are filters for bakeries that offer baked goods that are dairy-free, gluten-free, and vegan. There are also filters for bakeries that deliver or are appointment-only. Filters for online and farmer's market bakeries without physical locations are also included. The special category filters are based on the narrative provided in *Richmond Magazine* as of March 2022, so the bakeries' offerings may have changed. Contact the bakeries for the latest information.

- For bakeries without physical addresses, generic latitude and longitude for Richmond VA (37.541290, -77.434769) were used.

### Resources

- This project was inspired by Silvia Canel√≥n's excellent R-Ladies Philly workshop on webscraping, geocoding,
and interactive mapping. See all materials, including presentation slides and a RStudio Cloud project, in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/spcanelon/2022-ccd-sips). The workshop recording is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcfHr0oeOMw).

- The rvest [chapter](https://dcl-wrangle.stanford.edu/rvest.html) of the companion ebook for Stanford's Data Challenge Lab provided invaluable tips for easily determining the desired CCS selector(s) to scrape the webpage of interest.

- Shannon Pigelli's June 2022 [tutorial on purrr](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/talks/2022-06-08-iterating-well-with-purrr/) on her website Piping Hot Data greatly assisted in wrangling the scraped bakery data.

- Matt Dray has awesome examples of flexdashboard development using the crosstalk package in [this GH repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-crosstalk).

- Meghan Harris (The Tidy Trekker) has a terrific [tutorial](https://www.thetidytrekker.com/post/dull-dashboards) on customizing and styling flexdashboards.
