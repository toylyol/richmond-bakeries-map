# Richmond Bakeries Map
A sample web scaping, geocoding, and interactive mapping project

This sample project showcases web scaping, geocoding, and mapping. The result is a flexdashboard featuring an interactive (leaflet) map of bakeries in the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area. A searchable reactable is included for those who want to access the data in that format. The crosstalk package is used to enable interactivity while maintaining a self-contained product that can be readily shared without needing a server or a live R session.
